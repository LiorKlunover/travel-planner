*   **Local Tip:** Sunday afternoon might still be busy but generally less crowded than Friday afternoon/Saturday. Take your time, wander through the aisles, and let your senses guide you. Many vendors offer samples!

    *   **Walk:** Approximately 30-35 minutes back towards the Sarona/Azrieli complex. Again, consider the heat.
*   **Cost:** Entrance fee is approximately ₪22-₪25 ($6-$7 USD) per person.

*   **Shabbat:** While your visit is on a Sunday, be aware that Friday afternoon through Saturday evening is Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest. Public transportation largely shuts down, and many businesses (especially outside of Tel Aviv) close. Tel Aviv is generally more open than other cities during Shabbat, but it's good to be aware.
*   **Pace:** Tel Aviv is a lively city; embrace the Mediterranean pace and enjoy the moment.
*   **Hydration:** Cannot stress this enough for August! Drink plenty of water.
*   **Comfortable Shoes:** You'll be doing a fair amount of walking, even with public transport.
